# Tox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zetok/tox.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zetok/tox)


## Dependencies
| **Name** | **Version** |
|----------|-------------|
| libsodium | 1.0.8 |

## Building
Fairly simple. You'll need [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and libsodium.

Currently git version of `sodiumoxide` is required. To compile it successfully:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide && \
mkdir .cargo
echo 'paths = ["sodiumoxide/libsodium-sys"]' >> .cargo/config
```

When you'll have deps, build debug version with
```bash
cargo build
```

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test

```
To build docs:
```bash
cargo doc
```
They will be located under `target/doc/`


## Goals
 - improved toxcore implementation in Rust
 - Rust API
 - "old" C API for compatibility
 - documentation
 - tests
 - more
